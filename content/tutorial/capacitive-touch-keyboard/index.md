# Introduction

Capacitive touch sensing + interactivity introduction
Sketch demo (with video)

## Project materials:

- Parts required to build this
     - MPR121
     - Copper / wires

## Using I2C interface
- How to plug in
- Which pins?
- Working with I2c interface (sidenote or short paragraph)
     - Connecting many devices is possible
     - Which pins on the Pi can be used
     - What addresses are and how to know what to use
     - Processing class already implements functionality
     - Link to the other Processing I2C examples

## Capacitive touch sensing
- Short overview on how it works
- Devices that use capacitive touch sensing
     Phones / tablets
     Makey Makey
     Magic Mouse
- What else can we do with this?
     Making keyboard
    Audio visual experience
    Cover materials and interactivity - creative freedom for input method
    Unique output
    
## Making sound with Processing
